What are make and Makefiles?

make is a build automation tool that helps to manage the build process of software projects. It reads a file called Makefile to determine how to compile and link the source files to create the final executable or output.
A Makefile is a text file that contains rules and instructions for the make utility. It defines the dependencies between files, commands to be executed, and how to build the project.
When, why, and how to use Makefiles?

Makefiles are commonly used in software development projects when there are multiple source files, and you want to automate the compilation process.
They are beneficial when you have dependencies between files, so only the modified files and their dependencies are recompiled, reducing build time.
To use Makefiles, create a file named Makefile (or with a .mk extension) in the project directory and define the build rules and dependencies.
